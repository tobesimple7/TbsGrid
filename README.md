Welcome to TbsGrid.
This grid is javascript web grid.
I hope this grid helps you.

- The tbs prefix was created from the first letters of 'tobesimple.net'.
- The current github source and min files may be slightly different.
- I am currently trying to manage the version with the beta version.
- It seems like it will take 2 to 3 months to get to a more stable version.
 
I think it will stabilize once i test and fix bugs so that the release beta version becomes 2.0.0. haha.

## Notable features

- This grid is made with only pure JavaScript and CSS.
- It can also bind large amounts of data.
- Supports cross-browser.
- It has various functions such as column movement, sorting, filtering, etc.


## Getting Started

```javascript
// Grid Config 
<script src="/tbsgrid/configs/tbs.config.us.js"></script>
// TbsGrid css, js files
<script src="/tbsgrid/tbs.grid.1.0.0.min.css"></script>
<script src="/tbsgrid/tbs.grid.1.0.0.min.js"></script>
```
- The min files are not distributed yet.
- We plan to make a release version as soon as possible

tbs.config.us.js

- This file is the grid initial settings file for each country's currency unit or calendar-related characters.
- You can set it by country in the config file.
